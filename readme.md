Some of the major challenges that I faced with and how I overcame them:

One of the challenges I faced creating this web app was adding a preloading animation to the screen. I found an animation that was a perfect fit for the theme of the website, however we couldn't get it to function as a preloader, so to overcome this we decided to use a simpler method using a gif and creating an on load function to achieve the preloading effect. 


Code snippet that im proud of and why:

A code snippet that I'm proud of is my floating hero. It was a simple animation that adds to the feel of the website, adding the bow on top for this superhero web application.
